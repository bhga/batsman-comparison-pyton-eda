# batsman-comparison-pyton-eda
Here we have used python to compare two players using EDA based on stats available on cricbuzz

Criteria to decide power hitting best batsman

Hard Hitting Ability = (4*(No of Fours) + 6*(No of Sixes)) / Total Balls Played by Batsman

Fast Scoring Ability = Total Runs / Total Balls Played by Batsman

Running Between Wickets = (Total Runs – (4*(No of Fours) + *(No of Sixes)))/(Total Balls Played – Boundary Balls)

As per to the plot generated we can clearly come to a conclusion that Gill is more likely to perform better
