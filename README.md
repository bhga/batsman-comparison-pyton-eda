# batsman-comparison-pyton-eda
Here we have used python to compare two players using EDA based on stats available on cricbuzz

Criteria to decide power hitting best batsman

Hard Hitting Ability = (4*(No of Fours) + 6*(No of Sixes)) / Total Balls Played by Batsman

Fast Scoring Ability = Total Runs / Total Balls Played by Batsman

Running Between Wickets = (Total Runs – (4*(No of Fours) + *(No of Sixes)))/(Total Balls Played – Boundary Balls)

The bar plot shows at the current stage Gill is performing better than KL Rahul

The data availability of Gill is less in T20 and Test format so it is too early too say 

But there is a chance that Gill might perform better in ODI than KL Rahul would
